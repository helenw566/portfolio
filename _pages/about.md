Hello! My name is Helen and I am a second-year Master’s student at Georgetown University’s Data Science for Public Policy program. Prior to coming to Georgetown, I earned a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology along with a Certificate in Cognitive Science from Princeton University. As a first-generation, low-income student, I credit the support of the [QuestBridge National College Match Program](https://www.questbridge.org/apply-to-college/programs/national-college-match/the-match-scholarship) and the [National Institutes of Health Undergraduate Scholarship Program](https://www.training.nih.gov/research-training/pb/ugsp/) for making my educational journey possible.

My personal background has shaped my commitment in understanding how adversity and systemic inequities shape people’s decision-making, relationships, and long-term outcomes. With over 7+ years of experience in social science research—including work at the National Institutes of Health on health disparities and social networks—I have seen firsthand how evidence and data can drive meaningful social change. Over time, my interests have evolved from academic research to a broader focus on driving evidence-based recommendations in social, health, and criminal justice policy.

As a Data Scientist, I hope to leverage quantitative research and data analysis to address socioeconomic inequities and advance social justice through meaningful policy.
