Hello! My name is Helen and I am a second-year Master’s student at Georgetown University’s Data Science for Public Policy program. As a first-generation, low-income student, I’ve always been passionate about understanding how adversity and systemic inequities shape people’s decision-making, relationships, and long-term success. My background in psychology along with over 7+ years of experience in social science research—including work at the NIH on health disparities and social networks—has shown me how evidence and data can drive meaningful social change. My time at Georgetown has only strengthened my commitment and refined my computational skillset.

As a Data Scientist, I hope to leverage quantitative research and data analysis to address socioeconomic inequities and advance social justice.
